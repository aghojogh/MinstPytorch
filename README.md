# MNIST Dataset Classification by Deep Learning

A handwritten digit classifier using deep learning (PyTorch) on the MNIST dataset, featuring data preprocessing, model training, performance evaluation, and visualization with Python machine learning libraries.

I use convolutional neural network (CNN) for classification.
